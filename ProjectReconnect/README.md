# ProjectReconnect

This Document is created by Jianyi Ren at 4/29/2016 as part of the explanation for Project Reconnect for course 4761 at Columbia University.

This part explains how SNPs were screened, and how father/son/other relative samples were generated. 

The SNPs are screened as discussed in the paper 2.1 section paragraph 2 and 1~5 are the code and dataset for each step.

Simulation folder explains how simulated sample data are generated. Code and samples are included.

We also did a parallel SNP screening for Indian population. But failed to acquire enough SNPs. The source code and data set are not included here but can be provided upon request.
