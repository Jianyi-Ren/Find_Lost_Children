*Chr1~22_beforeLD.txt is the full list of SNPs passed 4-Frequency check for each chromosome
*SNP_subset_AllFrePass_1~22.txt is a random selected subset of Chr1~22_beforeLD.txt 

LDmatrix was used to check r2 for snps from SNP_subset_AllFrePass_1~22.txt. All highly correlated snps are eliminated manually(roughly).

*Chr1~22_r2.txt are the r2 matrix downloaded from http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/

LD.R was run to further make sure all high r2 snps are eliminated.


Finally, 384 SNPs were chosen. Final SNP list saved in file SNP_LE.txt
