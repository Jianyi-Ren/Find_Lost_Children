# ProjectReconnect

This Document is created by Jianyi Ren at 4/29/2016 as part of the explanation for Project Reconnect for course 4761 at Columbia University. The detailed project information can be found in this file:
*Luren,Calvin and Jianyi.pdf.

This part explains how SNPs were screened, and how father/son/other relative samples were generated:

The SNPs were screened as discussed in the paper Luren,Calvin and Jianyi.pdf paragraph 2 of 2.1 section.

'Simulation' folder explains how simulated sample data are generated. We also did a parallel SNP screening for Indian population. But failed to acquire enough SNPs. The source code and data set are not included here but can be provided upon request.
