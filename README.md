# ProjectReconnect

This is part of the explanation for Project Reconnect for course 4761 at Columbia University. 
We built a web-based database and platoform based on single nucleosdie polymoprhpsim(SNPs) 
to help identify lost/abducted children in China and reconnect them with their parents.

This part explains how SNPs were screened, and how father/son/other relative simulated samples were generated.
