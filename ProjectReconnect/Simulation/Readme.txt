as well as genotype of grandfather and grandson for 100000 times;
the match percentage for each pair were saved into sibling and son_grandfather

*simulation.py simulates genotype of N fathers and a son, depending on N = 100 and N = 100000 the results are saved in Son_100Father and Son_100000Father
-26% of son’s CNV is nullified into ‘9’
